1) Password Submssion

1) Ask the user for a password and a username, make sure the password is atleast 10 characters long, contains atleast two numbers (two unique numbers so no 66, 33, etc), one special character (!@#$%^&*()). Make sure the username is not directly inside the password so if the username is "Jake" and the password is "Jake24@$@Wsfs" than that's invalid because "Jake" is in the password ! 
2) If the password is good ask the user for their password again and see if the password they just gave matches the password the user gave earlier
3) If all good return the username and password else return a statement saying "Re-do" and have it re-do all the input statements (hint use a loop)
4) make this all a function
